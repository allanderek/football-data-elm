# Todo

- [x] I need to actually get the screen size in rows, so I will also need a resize event.
- [ ] I want to draw the screen but show the menu at the top or bottom (probably top to make it easy)
- [ ] I'd like to see the dates of games, this would mean the output would have to format it first and then take the number of lines the screen requires, but perhaps that's a good thing to do generically anyway.
- [ ] I'd like to know if a game is currently in progress or finished.
- [ ] It would be great if we could add a little colour, eg for games in progress.
